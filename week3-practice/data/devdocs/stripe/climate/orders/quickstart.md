Install the libraries:

```bash
npm install --save stripe @stripe/stripe-js next
```

### Create an endpoint to handle the request

Add an endpoint on your server that creates a [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md). The Checkout Session controls what your customer sees on the payment page.

### Calculate the order amount

Use [Climate Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product.md) to fetch the latest price and calculate the total order amount.

### Create a customer

Look up a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) in your database, or create a new `Customer` to represent who you’re invoicing.

### Create an empty invoice

Make sure to pass the [product.id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product/object.md#climate_product_object-id) in `metadata` and set the [collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object.md#invoice_object-collection_method) attribute to `send_invoice`. For Stripe to mark an invoice as past due, you must add the [days_until_due](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create.md#create_invoice-days_until_due) parameter. When you send an invoice, Stripe emails the invoice to the customer with payment instructions. For more invoice customization options, see [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices.md).

### Create an invoice item

Create an invoice item by passing in the `customer.id`, `invoice.id`, and the order’s `amount_total` and `currency`.

### Send the invoice

Send the invoice to the email address associated with the customer and redirect to a success page.

As soon as you send an invoice, Stripe finalizes it. Many jurisdictions consider finalized invoices a legal document making certain fields unalterable. If you send invoices that have already been paid, there’s no reference to the payment in the email.

With any finalized invoice, you can either download and send a [PDF](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object.md#invoice_object-invoice_pdf) or [link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object.md#invoice_object-hosted_invoice_url) to the associated [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page.md).

### Create a Checkout Session

Create a `Checkout Session` to collect payment from your customers.

### Configure the Checkout Session

Make sure to pass the [product.id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product/object.md#climate_product_object-id) in `metadata`. For more Checkout Session customization options, see [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md).

### Supply success and cancel URLs

Specify URLs for success and cancel pages—make sure they’re publicly accessible so Stripe can redirect customers to them. You can also handle both the success and canceled states with the same URL.

### Redirect to Checkout

After creating the session, redirect your customer to the URL for the Checkout page returned in the response.

### Create a top-up

This funds your order using your account’s linked bank account, passing [product.id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product/object.md#climate_product_object-id) in `metadata`. Make sure that your bank account allows for debits from Stripe, and has the balance available to cover your order.

### Create a carbon removal order

A [Climate Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/order.md) reserves the carbon removal and tracks it through delivery. The total amount is deducted from your [Stripe balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance.md).

> For production code, move creating the Climate Order to an offline process and handle duplicate events. See [Best practices for using webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#best-practices) for more details.

### Create a carbon removal order

When the user pays their invoice, create the [Climate Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/order.md). The total amount is deducted from your [Stripe balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance.md).

> For production code, move creating the Climate Order to an offline process and handle duplicate events. See [Best practices for using webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#best-practices) for more details.

### Create a carbon removal order

When the user completes their payment using Checkout, create the [Climate Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/order.md). The total amount is deducted from your [Stripe balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance.md).

> For production code, move creating the Climate Order to an offline process and handle duplicate events. See [Best practices for using webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#best-practices) for more details.

### Create a carbon removal order

When the top-up is successful, create the [Climate Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/order.md). The total amount is deducted from your [Stripe balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance.md).

> For production code, move creating the Climate Order to an offline process and handle duplicate events. See [Best practices for using webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#best-practices) for more details.

### Add an order preview page

Add a page to preview the carbon removal you’re selling and collect an email from your customer. Display your marketing assets here and clearly explain the expected delivery date and applicable guarantees for the product.

### Add an order preview page

Add a page to preview the carbon removal you’re selling. Display your marketing assets here and clearly explain the expected delivery date and applicable guarantees for the product.

### Add an order button

Add a button to place an order and send the invoice.

### Add an order button

Add a button to place an order. When your customer clicks this button, they’re redirected to the Stripe-hosted payment form.

### Handle redirect back from Checkout

Show a message to your customer when they’re redirected back to your page.

### Add an order page

Create a page in your application to place an order.

### Download the asset kit

Use [the asset kit](https://stripe-images.s3.amazonaws.com/content-store/climate/APIAssetKit.zip) to introduce your customers to carbon removal products.

### Set your environment variables

Add your publishable and secret keys to a `.env` file. Next.js automatically loads them into your application as [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables). Also include a webhook secret, which you can create in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) or with the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli.md).

### Run the application

Start your app with `npm run dev` and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Try it out

### Verify your carbon removal order

View the `Climate Order` in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/climate/orders) to confirm that it’s been created successfully.

    // Check to see if this is a redirect back from the server
    const query = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);

    if (query.get("success")) {
      setMessage("Order placed!");
    }
