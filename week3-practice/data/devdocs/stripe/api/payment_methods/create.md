# Create a PaymentMethod

Creates a PaymentMethod object. Read the [Stripe.js reference](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference.md#stripe-create-payment-method) to learn how to create PaymentMethods via Stripe.js.

Instead of creating a PaymentMethod directly, we recommend using the [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment.md) API to accept a payment immediately or the [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/save-and-reuse.md) API to collect payment method details ahead of a future payment.

## Returns

Returns a PaymentMethod object.
