# Create a PaymentIntent

Creates a PaymentIntent object.

After the PaymentIntent is created, attach a payment method and [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm.md) to continue the payment. Learn more about [the available payment flows with the Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents.md).

When you use `confirm=true` during creation, it’s equivalent to creating and confirming the PaymentIntent in the same call. You can use any parameters available in the [confirm API](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm.md) when you supply `confirm=true`.

If the payment method is `card_present` and isn’t a digital wallet, then a [generated_card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object.md#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-generated_card) payment method representing the card is created and attached to the Customer instead.

To learn more about 3DS flows, read our [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2#frictionless-authentication).

      If the payment method is `card_present` and isn’t a digital wallet, Stripe creates and attaches a [generated_card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object.md#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-generated_card) payment method representing the card to the Customer instead.
