    City, district, suburb, town, or village.

  - `address.country` (string, nullable)

  The current balance, if any, that’s stored on the customer in their default currency. If negative, the customer has credit to apply to their next invoice. If positive, the customer has an amount owed that’s added to their next invoice. The balance only considers amounts that Stripe hasn’t successfully applied to any invoice. It doesn’t reflect unpaid invoices. This balance is only taken into account after invoices finalize. For multi-currency balances, see [invoice_credit_balance](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object.md#customer_object-invoice_credit_balance).

- `business_name` (string, nullable)
  The customer’s business name.

  The maximum length is 150 characters.

- `cash_balance` (object, nullable)
  The current funds being held by Stripe on behalf of the customer. You can apply these funds towards payment intents when the source is “cash_balance”. The `settings[reconciliation_mode]` field describes if these funds apply to these payment intents manually or automatically.

  - `cash_balance.object` (string)
    String representing the object’s type. Objects of the same type share the same value.

  - `cash_balance.available` (object, nullable)
    A hash of all cash balances available to this customer. You cannot delete a customer with any cash balances, even if the balance is 0. Amounts are represented in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/currencies.md#zero-decimal).

  - `cash_balance.customer` (string)
    The ID of the customer whose cash balance this object represents.

  - `cash_balance.customer_account` (string, nullable)

  Three-letter [ISO code for the currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies) the customer can be charged in for recurring billing purposes.

- `delinquent` (boolean, nullable)
  Tracks the most recent state change on any invoice belonging to the customer. Paying an invoice or marking it uncollectible via the API will set this field to false. An automatic payment failure or passing the `invoice.due_date` will set this field to `true`.

  If an invoice becomes uncollectible by [dunning](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/automatic-collection.md), `delinquent` doesn’t reset to `false`.

  If you care whether the customer has paid their most recent subscription invoice, use `subscription.status` instead. Paying or marking uncollectible any customer invoice regardless of whether it is the latest invoice for a subscription will always set this field to `false`.

- `description` (string, nullable)

- `discount` (object, nullable)
  Describes the current discount active on the customer, if there is one.

They solely track amounts that Stripe hasn’t successfully applied to any invoice. Stripe only applies a balance in a specific currency to an invoice after that invoice (which is in the same currency) finalizes.

    - `sources.data.routing_number` (string, nullable)

    - `sources.data.status` (string)
      For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, `tokenized_account_number_deactivated` or `errored`. A bank account that hasn’t had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If the status is `tokenized_account_number_deactivated`, the account utilizes a tokenized account number which has been deactivated due to expiration or revocation. This account will need to be reverified to continue using it for money movement. If a payout sent to this bank account fails, we’ll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send [scheduled payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#payout-schedule) until the bank details are updated.

      For external accounts, possible values are `new`, `errored`, `verification_failed`, and `tokenized_account_number_deactivated`. If a payout fails, the status is set to `errored` and scheduled payouts are stopped until account details are updated. In the US and India, if we can’t [verify the owner of the bank account](https://support.stripe.com/questions/bank-account-ownership-verification), we’ll set the status to `verification_failed`. Other validations aren’t run against external accounts because they’re only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don’t apply.

            We strongly recommend that you rely on our SCA Engine to automatically prompt your customers for authentication based on risk level and [other requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication.md). However, if you wish to request 3D Secure based on logic from your own fraud engine, provide this option.

To learn more about 3DS flows, read our [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2#frictionless-authentication).

To learn more about 3DS flows, read our [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2#frictionless-authentication).

      - `subscriptions.data.pending_update.trial_end` (timestamp, nullable)
        Unix timestamp representing the end of the trial period the customer will get before being charged for the first time, if the update is applied.

      - `subscriptions.data.pending_update.trial_from_plan` (boolean, nullable)
        Indicates if a plan’s `trial_period_days` should be applied to the subscription. Setting `trial_end` per subscription is preferred, and this defaults to `false`. Setting this flag to `true` together with `trial_end` is not allowed. See [Using trial periods on subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials.md) to learn more.

    - `subscriptions.data.schedule` (string, nullable)
      The schedule attached to the subscription

    - `subscriptions.data.start_date` (timestamp)
      Date when the subscription was first created. The date might differ from the `created` date due to backdating.

    - `subscriptions.data.status` (enum)
      Possible values are `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, `unpaid`, or `paused`.

      For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in this status can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an `active` status. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal status, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated.

      A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over.

      A subscription can only enter a `paused` status [when a trial ends without a payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials.md#create-free-trials-without-payment). A `paused` subscription doesn’t generate invoices and can be resumed after your customer adds their payment method. The `paused` status is different from [pausing collection](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment.md), which still generates invoices and leaves the subscription’s status unchanged.

      If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically`, it becomes `past_due` when payment is required but cannot be paid (due to failed payment or awaiting additional user actions). Once Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings).

      If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.
