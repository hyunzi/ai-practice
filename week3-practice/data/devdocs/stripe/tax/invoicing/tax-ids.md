# Account and customer tax IDs with Invoicing

Learn about storing, validating, and rendering tax ID numbers for Invoicing.

With Stripe, you can manage tax IDs ​​for both yourself and your customers. Both the account and customer tax IDs display in the header of *invoice* (Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer. They track the status of payments from draft through paid or otherwise finalized. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices, or you can manually create a one-off invoice) and credit note PDFs.

## Account tax IDs 

Displaying your tax IDs on invoice documents is a common regulatory requirement.

With Stripe, you can add up to 100 tax IDs to your account. You can see your tax IDs in the header of invoice and credit note PDFs. You can:

- Select default tax IDs to appear on every invoice and credit note PDF.
- Define a list of tax IDs to appear on a specific invoice.

> You can’t add, change, or remove account tax IDs after an invoice is finalized.

## Managing account tax IDs 

You can add and delete tax IDs using the [invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) page in the Dashboard. After you add a tax ID in the Dashboard, you can set it as the default tax ID for every invoice and credit note PDF. Tax IDs are immutable—you can’t change the country and ID after you save the tax ID to your account.

Additionally, you can add and delete tax IDs with the [create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create.md) and [delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete.md) endpoints.

### Adding and removing IDs 

#### Dashboard

Visit the [invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) page. Click the **Tax** tab and add a new tax ID or remove an existing tax ID:

#### API

You can add and delete tax IDs using the tax ID [create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create.md) and [delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete.md) endpoints.

> To update a tax ID, delete the old ID and create ​​another one.

The following example creates a tax ID:

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/tax_ids \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d type=eu_vat \
  -d value=DE123456789
```

The following example deletes a tax ID:

```curl
curl -X DELETE https://api.stripe.com/v1/tax_ids/txi_123 \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:"
```

### Setting default tax IDs 

On the [invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) page, click the **Tax** tab and locate the tax ID you want to set as the default. Click the overflow menu (⋯), select **Set as default**, and click **Save**.

Set default account tax ID in the Dashboard

​​After you set a tax ID as the default, you can see a label in the tax information box:

## Displaying tax IDs on invoices 

Stripe automatically pulls your [default tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing/tax-ids.md#default-tax-ids) during invoice finalization.

To override the default and display multiple tax IDs on invoices, you can set tax IDs in the Dashboard or by using the API. To learn more about taxes and invoices, see [Taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes.md).

#### Dashboard

You can set a list of tax IDs in the Dashboard using the Invoice Editor. ​​You can’t modify account tax IDs after an Invoice has been finalized.

In the Invoice Editor, scroll down to the **Advanced Options** section. Click the checkboxes to toggle which tax IDs ​​to display on that invoice. To remove tax IDs from the invoice, uncheck the boxes.

#### Customer v1

After you add a tax ID to your account, you can use the API to specify up to 25 tax IDs with the `account_tax_ids` parameter for creating [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create.md#create_invoice-account_tax_ids), [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create.md#create_subscription-invoice_settings-account_tax_ids), and [subscription schedules](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/create.md#create_subscription_schedule-default_settings-invoice_settings-account_tax_ids). You must pass a list of object IDs to the `account_tax_ids` parameter.

The following example sets `account_tax_ids` during invoice creation:

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d customer="{{CUSTOMER_ID}}" \
  -d "account_tax_ids[0]"=txi_123 \
  -d "account_tax_ids[1]"=txi_456
```

​​You can use the update endpoints for [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update.md#update_invoice-account_tax_ids), [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update.md#update_subscription-invoice_settings-account_tax_ids), and [subscription schedules](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/update.md#update_subscription_schedule-default_settings-invoice_settings-account_tax_ids) to add, change, or remove account tax IDs.

The following example sets `account_tax_ids` on an existing subscription:

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d "invoice_settings[account_tax_ids][0]"=txi_123 \
  -d "invoice_settings[account_tax_ids][1]"=txi_456
```

#### Accounts v2

After you add a tax ID to your account, you can use the API to specify up to 25 tax IDs with the `account_tax_ids` parameter for creating [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create.md#create_invoice-account_tax_ids), [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create.md#create_subscription-invoice_settings-account_tax_ids), and [subscription schedules](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/create.md#create_subscription_schedule-default_settings-invoice_settings-account_tax_ids). You must pass a list of object IDs to the `account_tax_ids` parameter.

The following example sets `account_tax_ids` during invoice creation:

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d customer_account="{{CUSTOMERACCOUNT_ID}}" \
  -d "account_tax_ids[0]"=txi_123 \
  -d "account_tax_ids[1]"=txi_456
```

​​You can use the update endpoints for [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update.md#update_invoice-account_tax_ids), [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update.md#update_subscription-invoice_settings-account_tax_ids), and [subscription schedules](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/update.md#update_subscription_schedule-default_settings-invoice_settings-account_tax_ids) to add, change, or remove account tax IDs.

The following example sets `account_tax_ids` on an existing subscription:

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d "invoice_settings[account_tax_ids][0]"=txi_123 \
  -d "invoice_settings[account_tax_ids][1]"=txi_456
```

## Customer tax IDs 

Collecting and displaying a customer’s tax ID on an invoice is a common requirement for B2B sales. With Stripe, you can add up to five tax IDs to a customer. You can see a customer’s tax IDs in the header of invoice and credit note PDFs.

Stripe provides multiple ways to collect tax IDs:

- Stripe Checkout: Collect tax IDs as part of the customer checkout flow. Learn more about the tax IDs collected with [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout.md).
- API: Use the API to directly pass tax ID information to Stripe.
- Dashboard: Add a customer tax ID manually on the customers page in the Stripe Dashboard.

> [Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax) or [sign up](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for Stripe to enable Stripe Tax.

## Supported tax ID types 

> Need another tax ID type? Request additional tax ID types by emailing us at [stripe-tax@stripe.com](mailto:stripe-tax@stripe.com?subject=%5BTax%20ID%20request%5D).

Stripe supports displaying the tax ID types below on invoices. You can’t use Stripe Checkout to collect all of these tax IDs. See which [tax IDs you can collect with Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout.md).

\*Stripe Tax won't apply tax if this tax ID is provided, in line with the relevant laws.

## Validation 

It’s your responsibility to make sure customer information is accurate (including their tax ID). Stripe displays a customer tax ID on an invoice, whether or not it is valid.

Stripe checks the format of the tax ID against the expected format, and asynchronously validates the tax ID against the external tax authority system for the tax ID types below.

After a tax ID is confirmed as valid or invalid, it won’t be validated again automatically.

### European Value Added Tax (EU VAT) numbers

Stripe automatically validates all EU VAT numbers with the [European Commission’s VAT Information Exchange System (VIES)](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/). This process only verifies the validity of the tax ID, and not whether the customer’s name and address match what’s on the customers page in the Dashboard.

VIES validation usually takes only a few seconds, but might take longer, depending on the availability of the external tax authority system. Stripe automatically handles VIES downtime and attempts retries for you.

### United Kingdom Value Added Tax (GB VAT) numbers

Stripe automatically validates all GB VAT numbers with the [United Kingdom’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC)](https://www.gov.uk/). This process only verifies the validity of the tax ID, not whether the customer’s name and address match what’s on the customers page in the Dashboard.

HMRC validation usually takes only a few seconds, but might take longer, depending on availability. Stripe automatically handles HMRC downtime and attempts retries for you.

### Validation webhooks and Dashboard display

Because this validation process happens asynchronously, the customer.tax_id.updated webhook  notifies you of validation updates.
![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/ids_valid_vat_registered.8c8f0b149549b3f3dd82b62f4e97ebfa.png)

The Dashboard displays the validation results from government databases, including the customer name and address. However, it’s your responsibility to verify whether these validation results match the address and name on the customers page in the Dashboard.

### Validation and tax calculations

If you use Stripe Tax and your customer provides a tax ID, Stripe Tax applies the reverse charge or zero rate according to applicable laws, as long as the tax ID conforms to the necessary number format, regardless of its validity.

## Managing customer tax IDs 

You can manage tax IDs in the Customers page in the Dashboard, in the customer portal, or with the API.

#### Dashboard

To add a customer tax ID in the Dashboard, go to the Customers page, and click **Update details** in the top of the **Details** panel. The Update customer invoice details modal opens, with the tax ID section visible.

Clicking the **Add tax ID** link adds a row to the tax ID list, where you can select the ID type and value. Removing the row removes a tax ID from a customer.

#### Customer v1

You can add or delete tax IDs using the API.

> To update a tax ID, delete the old ID and create ​​another one.

The following example shows how to [create a new tax ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create.md) on a Customer, storing their VAT number.

curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/tax_ids \
