# Manage payment methods

Use dynamic payment methods or manually define the payment methods to allow per checkout session.

Stripe dynamically displays the most relevant payment methods to your customers based on the payment method preferences you set in the Dashboard and eligibility factors such as transaction amount, currency, and payment flow. To enable and manage your payment method preferences, go to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe enables certain payment methods for you by default and might enable additional payment methods after notifying you.

## Manually specify payment methods

You can override Dashboard settings by manually specifying [payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-payment_method_types) when creating the Checkout Session. Unless your integration requires that you list payment methods manually, we recommend that you manage payment methods from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).

If multiple payment methods are passed, Stripe dynamically reorders them to prioritize the most relevant payment methods based on the customer’s location and other characteristics.
