# Wallets

Learn about wallet payments with Stripe.

Customers can use wallets to pay online with a saved card or a digital wallet balance. Retailers often use wallets to:

- Reduce fraud and increase conversion on mobile.
- Reach buyers in China, where wallets are the most popular way to pay.

Wallets might not be a good fit for your business if you sell *subscriptions* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis). Some wallets don’t support recurring payments.

## Payment flow 

Customers *confirm* (Confirming an intent indicates that the customer intends to use the current or provided payment method. Upon confirmation, the intent attempts to initiate the portions of the flow that have real-world side effects) the transaction by authenticating their wallet credentials at checkout. If using mobile, they can authenticate with fingerprint or face recognition, their mobile passcode, or by logging into their wallet app. On the web, they can also scan a QR code with their mobile phone to complete the transaction.

1 Cards and bank debit methods including SEPA debit, AU BECS direct debit, and ACSS debit support both `on_session` and `off_session` with [setup future usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create.md#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage). All other payment method types either don’t support `setup_future_usage` or only support `off_session`.2 Payment methods might require confirmation with [return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md#confirm_payment_intent-return_url) to indicate where Stripe should redirect your customer after they complete the payment.
